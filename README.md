# pui-demo-project
A blank slate for playing with or accepting pui components

You can put react components in myComponents.js and css components in index.html to try them out. You need to install the appropriate packages, either the released versions (follow the [styleguide instructions](http://styleguide-staging.cfapps.io/)) or the [bleeding edge versions found here](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CORE_TEAM_DOCS.md#acceptance).

When running gulp, it will serve on port 8080.
